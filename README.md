## Promise.Monster

This monster makes it easy for you to promise or to materialized a future state of affairs which has been promised to you. Promises are tokenized and embody the ERC721 standard. They typically project a specific change in global state within a stated time frame. Such changes can refer to wrapped assets (ERC20 or ERC721s wrapped as an ERC721) or to external such assets. The faileure to materialize a promise reflects negatively on the promisory record of the issuing or guaranteeing parties. <br>

Beneficiaries can transfer promises freely. Issuers cannot, at least not directly but only though a pull pattern since such a transfer of liability should require consent. To note, a transfer of liability does not absolve the initial issuer from the reputational costs in case of its failure. As such, the issuer cannot externalize the costs of failure.
